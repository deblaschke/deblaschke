### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on color-correcting photographs scanned from decades-old film (completed 1988-1992 so far) ... those reds really take over as the years pass by!
- ðŸ’¬ Please feel free to ask me about any place appearing in the travel slideshows, I've spent more time planning our travels than actually traveling and am blessed/cursed with a photographic memory, so I can probably answer most questions regarding what, when, where, etc. (or at least make up something that sounds good ðŸ˜‰)
