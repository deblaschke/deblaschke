### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on scanning 500+ rolls of 35mm film for slideshows from 1989 thru 2006 (now complete through 1999)
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about any place appearing in the slideshows, I've probably spent more time planning our travels than actually traveling and am blessed (or cursed) with a photographic memory, so I can probably answer most questions (or at least make up sometyhing that sounds good ðŸ˜‰)
- ðŸ“· Slideshows can be accessed here: https://deblaschke.github.io/travel-slideshows/
- ðŸŽ¥ GoPro videos of some of America's more beautiful drives can be accessed here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdJHbL9SbseUVuoaGXZma4g
